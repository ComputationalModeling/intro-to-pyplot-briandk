Description: This small collection of functions provides
    what we call elemental graphics for display of anova
    results. The term elemental derives from the fact that
    each function is aimed at construction of graphical
    displays that afford direct visualizations of data with
    respect to the fundamental questions that drive the
    particular anova methods. The main function is
    granovagg.1w (a graphic for one way anova). This
    function was written to display data for any number
    of groups, regardless of their sizes (however, very
    large data sets or numbers of groups can be
    problematic). A specialized
    approach is used to construct data-based contrast
    vectors for which anova data are displayed. The result
    is that the graphics use straight lines to facilitate clear
    interpretations while being faithful to the standard
    effect tests in anova. The graphic results are
    complementary to standard summary tables for this
    basic kind of analysis of variance; numerical summary
    results of analyses are also provided as side effects.
    Two additional functions are granovagg.ds (for comparing
    two dependent samples), and granovagg.contr (which
    provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All
    functions provide relevant numerical results to
    supplement the graphic displays of anova data. The
    graphics based on these functions should be especially
    helpful for learning how the methods have been applied
    to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be
    particularly helpful for students and non-statistician
    analysts. But these methods should be quite generally
    helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as
    they can help to identify outliers, clusters or
    patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear
    transformations of data. In the case of granovagg.1w and
    granovagg.ds especially, several arguments are provided
    to facilitate flexibility in the construction of
    graphics that accommodate diverse features of data,
    according to their corresponding display requirements.
